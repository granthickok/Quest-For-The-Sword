## Special Notes
- Java version 1.8.0 is the version this application was designed to run in but may work with newer versions.
- If javafx is not included in the java version you are attempting to run the program you will have to download and specify the path to the install using the arguments `--module-path "Path\To\javafx-sdk\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml` where `Path\To\javafx-sdk` is the local path to javafx on your machine.
- Make sure that the javafx build path is set before running through Eclipse
- Make sure that java is installed on your computer before running through .jar file
